# UnitCalculator
A small application to help calculate hours/units for LTSS tracking

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The software does not require installation and can be run portably. The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/SCLDGit/UnitCalculator/releases/download/v2023.1/UnitCalculator.exe)


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Usage Instructions

### Date Selection

1. **Start and End Date:** At the top of the window, use the two date pickers to select a start and an end date. Note that the end date cannot be more than a year after the start date, and cannot be before the start date.

### Hour Selection

2. **Setting Hours:** Below the date pickers, use numeric selectors to choose the number of hours of service provided for each day of the week.

### Calculation

3. **Calculate:** Click the "Calculate" button to process your input. This will populate a new area at the bottom of the window.

### Results Display

4. **Toggle Switch:** In the new area, use the toggle switch at the top to switch between displaying hours or units. One unit is equivalent to 15 minutes.

5. **Month Selection:** On the left, select a month from the box to view data.

6. **Calendar View:** On the right, a calendar layout will display each day of the selected month, showing the number of hours or units corresponding to that date.
